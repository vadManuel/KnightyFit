Workout.js & Home.js are the pages for components in the App.js
Workout Card and graph lie in the workout card folder, the Workout Card is used on the home page as well. 
the workouts folder holds monthly.js which is the div that holds the whole page, you can move the file structure around as needed.
myapp.css just needs to be thrown into the larger app.css file
Thanks :)
